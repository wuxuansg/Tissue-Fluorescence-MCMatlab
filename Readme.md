Read me for Tissue-Fluorescence-MCMatlab:

Please download the source code of MCMatlab and add it to your MATLAB path: https://github.com/ankrh/MCmatlab

1. AirFADNADH.m: Models oral tissue with fluorophores as 3 layers in the MCMatlab geometry. Top: Air; Middle: FAD; Bottom: NADH.
2. KeratinFADNADH.m: Models oral tissue with fluorophores as 3 layers in the MCMatlab geometry. Top: Keratin; Middle: FAD; Bottom: NADH.
3. Keratin_WuandQu.mat, FAD_eem.mat, NADH_eem.mat are 3 fluorophores EEM, as input parameter for MCMatlab.
4. fluorophoreCreate.m, fluorophoreGet.m, fluorophoreRead.m, fluorophoreSet.m, t_flRead.m are reading functions for extracting EEM dataset.
